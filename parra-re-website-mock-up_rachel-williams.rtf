\f0\fs24 \cf0 For the final project I initially thought of having a 4 page website, clicking from one page to the next. With the 4 pages being 'About', 'Resume', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact'. Big images. Simple and clean look.\
Then after some research, I found I actually I liked the look of the scrolling page effect (parallax?) as seen on page 3 of my PDF. Having said that, I'm not sure how to go about this, in terms of code, but hope to work that out ASAP!}
